Level 0 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Description – SOAR Platform
‐------------------------------------------------------------



The Level 0 Data Flow Diagram represents the SOAR platform as a single high-level process and shows how it interacts with external entities. This context diagram provides an overview of the flow of security-related data without exposing internal processing details.


External Security Tools such as SIEM, IDS, firewalls, and endpoint detection systems generate security alerts and send them to the SOAR platform for analysis and response. The SOAR platform acts as the central system that receives these alerts and coordinates incident handling activities.


The Security Analyst interacts with the SOAR platform by providing manual approvals, overrides, and updates when required. The platform also sends incident updates, notifications, and reports to the Security Analyst to support monitoring and decision-making.


The System Administrator configures and updates response playbooks that define how the SOAR platform should react to different types of security incidents. These configurations influence the system’s response behavior.


The SOAR platform communicates with the Notification Service to request the delivery of notifications. The Notification Service then sends incident and failure alerts to the Security Analyst to ensure timely human intervention when automated resolution is not sufficient.


Overall, this Level 0 DFD illustrates the high-level interaction between the SOAR platform and its external entities, emphasizing the flow of alerts, approvals, notifications, and configuration data.
