Use Case Diagram Description
-----------------------------

The use case diagram represents the interaction between users and the SOAR system.
The main actors are SOC Analyst, Security Administrator, and External Security Tools.

The SOC Analyst interacts with use cases such as viewing incidents, approving actions,
and monitoring alerts. The Security Administrator manages users, roles, and system
configuration. External Security Tools generate alerts that are ingested by the system.

The diagram helps in understanding the functional behavior and scope of the SOAR system.
