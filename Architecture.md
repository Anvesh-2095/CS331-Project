# SOAR System Architecture

This document describes the high-level architecture of the SOAR platform.

The system follows a modular design consisting of alert ingestion, normalization,
correlation, incident management, playbook execution, response actuation, and
notification components. Each module operates independently and communicates
through well-defined interfaces to ensure scalability, reliability, and ease of
maintenance.

Detailed module responsibilities and interaction flows will be expanded as the
implementation progresses.
