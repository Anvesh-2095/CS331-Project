# SOAR System Architecture

This document describes the high-level architecture of the SOAR platform.

The system follows a modular design consisting of alert ingestion, normalization,
correlation, incident management, playbook execution, response actuation, and
notification components. Each module operates independently and communicates
through well-defined interfaces to ensure scalability, reliability, and ease of
maintenance.

Detailed module responsibilities and interaction flows will be expanded as the
implementation progresses.

## SOAR System Architecture

This document describes the microservices-based architecture of the SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platform.

The system is designed using a modular microservices approach, where each service performs a specific responsibility. The services communicate through well-defined interfaces, allowing the system to be scalable, maintainable, and easy to test.

### in microservices style, the following services will be implemented

1. service to read notifications / alerts and pass them to brain
2. brain, actual logic will be written here
3. playbook, which will try to shrug off the attack / alert
4. a notification service used when SOAR platform cannot solve the problem
5. a artifact recording service which sits between controller and notification service

###### the following services will also be needed or simulated

1. a simulation of alert
2. a simulation of actuators - planning to make it synchronous to playbook service, so we can define outcome on our own while testing

and a dashboard is also required which is connected to the controller module
plus a logging service whis is connected to the brain





to make it scalable and cheaper, we will host it on the cloud and will host them based on zones across the world, to reduce latency.

users may also host it on their local system.



## Core Services

1. Alert Ingestion Service  
   This service is responsible for receiving security alerts and notifications. Alerts may originate from real security tools or from a simulated alert source. The service reads incoming alerts, performs basic validation, and forwards them to the Brain service for further analysis.
2. Brain Service  
   The Brain service contains the core decision-making logic of the SOAR system. It analyzes incoming alerts, evaluates their severity and type, and determines the appropriate response strategy. Based on this analysis, the Brain service selects a suitable playbook and triggers its execution.
3. Playbook Service  
   The Playbook service executes predefined response workflows. Each playbook consists of ordered steps that attempt to mitigate or resolve a security incident. The playbook interacts with actuator simulations to perform response actions and reports the outcome back to the Brain service.
4. Notification Service  
   The Notification service is used when the SOAR platform is unable to fully resolve an incident automatically. It sends notifications or alerts to security analysts or administrators, informing them about unresolved incidents or required manual intervention.
5. Artifact Recording Service  
   The Artifact Recording service records important artifacts such as alerts, incident details, response actions, and outcomes. This service sits between the controller logic and the Notification service to ensure that all relevant data is stored before notifications are sent. It supports auditing, reporting, and later analysis.

## Supporting and Simulated Services

6. Alert Simulation Service  
   This service simulates the generation of security alerts for testing and demonstration purposes. It allows the system to be tested without relying on real security tools.
7. Actuator Simulation Service  
   This service simulates response actions such as IP blocking, account suspension, or endpoint isolation. The actuator simulation is designed to operate synchronously with the Playbook service. During testing, predefined outcomes can be configured to simulate successful or failed response actions.

## Interaction Flow

1. An alert is generated by the Alert Simulation Service or an external source.
2. The Alert Ingestion Service receives the alert and forwards it to the Brain service.
3. The Brain service analyzes the alert and selects an appropriate playbook.
4. The Playbook service executes response steps and interacts with the Actuator Simulation Service.
5. Response outcomes are returned to the Brain service.
6. If the incident cannot be resolved, the Notification service is triggered.
7. The Artifact Recording Service stores all relevant data before notifications are sent.

## Architecture Benefits

* Clear separation of responsibilities across services
* Independent development and testing of each service
* Easy simulation of alerts and response actions
* Improved scalability and maintainability
* Suitable for incremental implementation and future enhancements

This microservices-based architecture provides a flexible and extensible foundation for building and testing a SOAR platform in an academic or experimental environment.
