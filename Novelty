Novelty in the Proposed SOAR Project

While traditional SOAR platforms focus primarily on automating predefined response workflows, the novelty of this project lies in making automation context-aware, failure-resilient, and human-centric, rather than purely rule-driven.

1. Failure-Aware Automation with Human-in-the-Loop Escalation

Most SOAR implementations assume that automated actions will succeed. In contrast, this project explicitly treats automation failure as a first-class event.
Whenever an automated response fails due to tool unavailability, permission issues, or execution errors, the system:

Captures failure artifacts

Records the failure context

Immediately notifies a human analyst

This approach improves operational reliability and ensures that automation does not silently fail, which is a common weakness in existing systems.

2. Explicit Incident Lifecycle Modeling

Instead of treating incidents as static records, this system models incidents as stateful entities with controlled lifecycle transitions (Open → In Progress → Escalated → Resolved).
This introduces:

Clear accountability

Auditability

SLA tracking potential

Such explicit lifecycle enforcement is often missing in academic SOAR projects and reflects real SOC operational practices.

3. Context-Driven Playbook Selection

Rather than triggering responses purely based on alert type, the system selects playbooks using incident context, including:

Severity

Correlation results

Incident priority

This reduces over-automation and ensures that responses are proportional to the actual risk, improving decision quality.

4. Simulation-Driven Design for Testing and Validation

A built-in alert simulation mechanism is used to emulate real security events.
This enables:

Safe testing of automation workflows

Validation of playbooks without production systems

Repeatable experimentation

This design choice allows the platform to be evaluated realistically even without access to enterprise-grade security tools.

5. Separation of Coordination and Actuation

The system clearly separates:

Orchestration logic (decision-making, playbook execution)

Actuation logic (actual response execution)

This modularity:

Improves maintainability

Enables future extension

Allows safer automation control

Such separation reflects production-grade architectural thinking rather than a monolithic design.

6. Audit-First Architecture

Every alert, action, approval, failure, and resolution is logged with timestamps and context.
This makes the platform:

Compliance-ready

Explainable

Suitable for post-incident analysis

Instead of adding logging as an afterthought, auditability is embedded into the core design.
