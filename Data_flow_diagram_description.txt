Level 0 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) – SOAR System


Overview
---------
The Level 0 DFD (Context Diagram) represents the SOAR system as a single process and shows how it interacts with external entities. It gives a high-level view of how security alerts enter the system and how responses and notifications are generated.


External Entities
------------------
1. External Security Tools
   These tools generate security alerts and send them to the SOAR system.

2. Security Analyst
   The analyst receives notifications, provides manual approval for high-risk actions, and monitors incidents.

3. Notification Service
   This service delivers alerts and notifications generated by the SOAR system to the analyst.


Main Process
-------------
1. SOAR System
This is the central process that:
* Receives security alerts
* Processes and analyzes alerts
* Creates and manages incidents
* Executes automated or manual responses


2. Data Stores
* Incident Database:
  Stores incident details, status, and lifecycle information.
* Logs & Artifacts Store:
  Stores logs, alerts, response results, and other security artifacts.


3. Data Flows
* Security Alerts:
  From External Security Tools -> SOAR System
* Incident Data / Response Actions:
  From SOAR System -> Incident Database
* Logs and Artifacts:
  From SOAR System -> Logs & Artifacts Store
* Approval Requests / Notifications:
  From SOAR System -> Security Analyst (via Notification Service)
* Manual Approval / Decisions:
  From Security Analyst -> SOAR System
