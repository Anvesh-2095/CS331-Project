Level 0 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) – SOAR System


Overview
---------
The Level 0 DFD (Context Diagram) represents the SOAR system as a single process and shows how it interacts with external entities. It gives a high-level view of how security alerts enter the system and how responses and notifications are generated.


External Entities

1. External Security Tools
   These tools generate security alerts and send them to the SOAR system.

2. Security Analyst
   The analyst receives notifications, provides manual approval for high-risk actions, and monitors incidents.

3. Notification Service
   This service delivers alerts and notifications generated by the SOAR system to the analyst.
