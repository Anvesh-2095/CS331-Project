This project focuses on SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) in the domain of computer security. The aim is to study, design, and eventually implement a system that demonstrates how security incidents can be detected, analyzed, and responded to in an automated and orchestrated manner.



Project Scope
---------------
This project focuses on understanding the working of a SOAR system in a computer security environment. The scope of the project includes studying security incidents, analyzing how alerts are generated by different security tools, and designing automated workflows to handle such incidents in an efficient manner.



Motivation
--------------
Organizations receive a large number of security alerts every day. Handling these alerts manually requires time and effort and may lead to delays in response. This project is motivated by the need to reduce manual work and improve the speed and accuracy of security incident response using automation.



System Functionality
----------------------
The SOAR system collects alerts from multiple security sources, processes and analyzes them, and creates security incidents. Based on predefined rules and workflows, the system can automatically perform response actions or request approval from a security analyst before taking critical actions.



Security and Access Control
-----------------------------
The system ensures secure access by allowing only authorized users to perform actions. Role-based access control is used to restrict user permissions, and all activities are logged for accountability.



Expected Outcomes
--------------------
The expected outcome of this project is faster incident response, reduced manual workload, and improved consistency in handling security incidents. The system also helps in maintaining proper records for auditing and reporting purposes.



High-Level Workflow
---------------------
Security alerts are generated by external security tools.
Alerts are collected and converted into a common format.
Related alerts are correlated and grouped into incidents.
Automated response playbooks are executed based on incident type.
All actions and decisions are logged for review and auditing.



Key Features
--------------
Centralized security alert management.
Alert normalization and correlation.
Automated incident creation and tracking.
Playbook-based automated responses.
Manual approval for high-impact actions.
Audit logging and reporting support.




System Requirements Summary
-----------------------------
Integration with multiple security tools.
Near real-time alert processing.
Secure role-based access control.
High availability and scalability.
Support for cloud and on-premise deployment.
