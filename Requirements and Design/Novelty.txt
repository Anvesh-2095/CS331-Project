1)Failure-Aware Automation
The system remembers failed automated actions and avoids repeating the same failures in similar future incidents.

2)Safety-Bounded Responses
Automated actions are restricted by predefined risk limits so automation cannot cause more damage than manual handling.

3)Incident-Centric Design
Incidents are treated as stateful entities with controlled lifecycle stages instead of being simple alert groupings.

4)Context-Aware Playbook Selection
Response playbooks are selected based on incident severity, priority, and correlation context rather than only alert type.

5)Simulation-Based Validation
Simulated alerts and failure scenarios are used to test and validate response workflows before real deployment.

6)Human-in-the-Loop Escalation
Automation failures and high-risk actions are automatically escalated to human analysts for intervention.

7)Separation of Orchestration and Actuation
Decision-making logic is separated from response execution to improve safety, maintainability, and extensibility.

8)Audit-First Design
All alerts, actions, approvals, and failures are logged to ensure transparency, traceability, and compliance.
