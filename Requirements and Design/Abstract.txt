SOAR

- The system includes a simulated alert generation component to emulate security events from external sources.
- An alert ingestion module reads incoming alerts and normalizes them into a common internal format.
- Normalized alerts are forwarded to a processing module for correlation and incident creation.
- A playbook evaluation module determines the appropriate response workflow based on incident context and severity.
- Response actions defined in the playbook are executed through a dedicated actuation module.
- In case of execution failure or exception, control is passed to an error-handling module.
- The error-handling module records relevant artifacts and notifies a human analyst for manual intervention.
