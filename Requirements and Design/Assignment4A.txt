The SOAR platform follows the Microservices Architecture style because:
* The system is divided into independent services, each responsible for a specific function.
* Each service operates as a separate deployable unit called module.
* Each module perform specific function.
* Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces (APIs).
* The logic is not tightly coupled into a single codebase.
* System follows high cohesion and low coupling.



Granularity of Components
--------------------------
The system is divided into the following fine-grained services:
Alert Ingestion Service
Brain (Decision Engine) Service
Playbook Execution Service
Artifact Recording Service
Notification Service
Alert Simulation Service
Actuator Simulation Service

Each service:
Has a single responsibility
Can be modified independently
Can be scaled independently

This separation clearly reflects microservices-level granularity.
