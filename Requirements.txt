FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
- Ingest security alerts from multiple external sources including SIEM, IDS/IPS, firewall, and endpoint protection systems.
- Normalize incoming alerts into a common internal format to support correlation and analysis.
- Correlate alerts using attributes such as source/destination IP, timestamp, severity level, and alert category.
- Automatically create and manage incident cases with defined lifecycle states (Open, In Progress, Escalated, Resolved).
- Support configuration and execution of response playbooks consisting of ordered actions and conditional logic.
- Execute automated response actions such as IP blocking, user account suspension, and endpoint isolation.
- Require manual analyst approval for predefined high-impact response actions.
- Provide real-time notifications for incident creation, escalation, and resolution.
- Maintain detailed audit logs of alerts, analyst actions, approvals, and automated responses.
- Generate incident summary and compliance-ready reports.

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------
- Process incoming alerts with near real-time latency suitable for security operations.
- Support scaling to handle increasing alert volumes and number of integrated tools.
- Ensure high availability of core incident handling and orchestration services.
- Enforce role-based access control for all users and system functions.
- Protect sensitive data using encryption in transit and at rest.
- Provide an intuitive web-based interface aligned with SOC analyst workflows.
- Allow configuration changes and playbook updates without system downtime.

SYSTEM AND DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------
- Deployable in cloud-based or on-premise enterprise environments.
- Accessible through modern web browsers without additional client-side installations.
- Integrates with external security tools via standard API-based interfaces.
- Requires persistent storage for incident data, logs, and configuration metadata.
- Supports secure authentication mechanisms for user access.
