The SOAR platform follows the Microservices Architecture style because:
* The system is divided into independent services, each responsible for a specific function.
* Each service operates as a separate deployable unit called module.
* Each module perform specific function.
* Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces (APIs).
* The logic is not tightly coupled into a single codebase.
* System follows high cohesion and low coupling.



Granularity of Components
--------------------------
The system is divided into the following fine-grained services:
Alert Ingestion Service
Brain (Decision Engine) Service
Playbook Execution Service
Artifact Recording Service
Notification Service
Alert Simulation Service
Actuator Simulation Service

Each service:
Has a single responsibility
Can be modified independently
Can be scaled independently

This separation clearly reflects microservices-level granularity.



The Microservices Architecture is the most appropriate choice for the SOAR system due to the following technical and practical reasons:

1. Scalability
* The SOAR system processes security alerts that may increase rapidly during cyber-attacks.
* In a microservices architecture, each service can scale independently.
* For example:
● Alert Ingestion Service can scale during high alert volume.
● Playbook Execution Service can scale when multiple incidents occur simultaneously.
* The entire system does not need to scale as one large unit.
* This reduces resource usage and improves performance efficiency.

2. Maintainability
* Each service has a single responsibility (e.g., alert ingestion, playbook execution, notification).
* Developers can modify one service without affecting others.
* Codebase remains smaller and easier to understand.
* Bugs can be isolated to a specific service.
* Maintenance becomes faster and safer compared to monolithic systems.

3. Fault Isolation and Reliability
* In a monolithic system, failure in one module can crash the entire system.
* In microservices:
● If Notification Service fails, alert processing continues.
● If Actuator Simulation fails, logging and artifact recording still function.
* This improves system reliability.
* Critical security operations remain operational even if one service fails.

4. Flexibility and Extensibility
* New services can be added without redesigning the entire system.
* For example:
● Threat Intelligence Service can be added later.
● Machine Learning-based Detection Service can be integrated in future.
* Services can be upgraded independently.
* Different technologies can be used for different services if required.

5. Performance Optimization
* Resource-heavy components (like Brain/Decision Engine) can be optimized separately.
* CPU-intensive services can be deployed on stronger machines.
* Lightweight services can run on minimal resources.
* This allows better performance tuning compared to a single large application.

6. Alignment with SOAR Functional Requirements
* The SOAR system requires:
● Alert processing
● Incident correlation
● Playbook execution
● Response automation
● Logging and notification
* Each of these functionalities is naturally modular.
* Microservices architecture directly supports:
● Separation of orchestration logic
● Separation of automation logic
● Independent response components
* This makes the architecture well-aligned with the system’s functional design.

7. Future Deployment Readiness
* Microservices architecture supports containerization (e.g., Docker).
* Supports cloud deployment.
* Suitable for distributed environments.
* Ready for enterprise-level expansion.
