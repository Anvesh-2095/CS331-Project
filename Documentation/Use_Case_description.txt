Use Case Diagram Description – SOAR Platform
----------------‐-----------------------------
The use case diagram represents the behavioral view of the Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) system by illustrating how external actors interact with the system to handle security incidents.
The SOAR Platform acts as the central system boundary within which all security orchestration and response activities take place.


Actors
--------
* External Security Tools generate security alerts that are consumed by the SOAR system.
* Security Analyst interacts with the system to monitor incidents, approve high-risk actions, and handle escalations.
* System Administrator configures response playbooks and manages system behavior.
* Notification Service is used to deliver alerts and incident notifications to human analysts.


Use Case Flow
--------------
The process begins when External Security Tools send alerts to the system through the Ingest Security Alerts use case. These alerts are then processed through Normalize Alerts and Correlate Alerts to reduce.  noise and identify meaningful security events.
Once correlated, the system creates a structured incident using the Create Incident use case. The incident is tracked and updated through the Manage Incident Lifecycle use case, which maintains states such as Open, In Progress, Escalated, and Resolved.
Based on the incident context, the system executes the Execute Response Playbook use case. This use case includes the Perform Automated Response functionality, which carries out predefined response actions.
For high-impact or risky actions, the Request Manual Approval use case extends the playbook execution, requiring explicit approval from a Security Analyst before proceeding.
If an automated response fails due to errors or unavailable integrations, the Handle Failure / Exception use case is triggered as an extension of automated response. In such cases, the system records relevant artifacts and invokes the Notify Analyst use case to ensure human intervention.
Throughout the incident handling process, the Record Artifacts & Logs use case maintains detailed audit information to support transparency, compliance, and post-incident analysis.


Use Case Relationships
------------------------
The use case diagram includes association, include, and extend relationships to represent system behavior clearly.
Association relationships show direct interactions between actors and use cases.
The Execute Response Playbook use case includes Perform Automated Response, as automated actions are a mandatory part of playbook execution.
The Request Manual Approval use case extends playbook execution and is triggered only when an action is classified as high-impact.
The Handle Failure / Exception use case extends automated response to manage error conditions and unresolved incidents.


System Boundary and Scope
--------------------------
All use cases are contained within the SOAR Platform system boundary, which defines the scope of automation, orchestration, and response activities.
External actors such as security tools and notification services interact with the system but remain outside the boundary.
The diagram clearly separates automated system behavior from human decision-making responsibilities.



Purpose of the Use Case Diagram
---------------------------------
The use case diagram helps in understanding the functional behavior of the SOAR platform from a user perspective.
It provides a clear view of how alerts are handled, how incidents are managed, and how automated and manual responses are coordinated.
This diagram serves as a foundation for requirement analysis, system design, and further implementation of the SOAR platform.



Conclusion
------------
The use case diagram effectively captures the interactions between users, external systems, and the SOAR platform.
It highlights the balance between automation and human control, ensuring both efficiency and safety in security incident response.
